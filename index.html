    <h2>Does Uber & Lyft Do Background Checks?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Uber does background checks for drivers. The screenings are done by the company Checkr, Inc. and take 3-5 days to complete on average. With Lyft, the process is done much quicker 1-3 days to complete on average.</p>

    <p>The background check includes a review of your Motor Vehicle Record. In addition, a criminal background check is
    administered.</p>

    <p>A background check will vary in cities. Rideshare regulations and local laws govern drivers based on criteria specified
    by the city.</p>

    <p><strong>Here is a quick list of things required to pass.</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Zero accidents with a fatality</li>

    <h2>How to become an Uber and Lyft driver</h2>

    <p>Read the easy step-by-step guide to becoming an Uber driver here.</p>

    <p><strong>Here is a quick summary of the necessary steps:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>Fill out the tactical driver application here for <a class="link" href="https://partners.uber.com/i/vvcr4j2gb">Uber</a> and this one for <a class="link" href="https://www.lyft.com/drivers/DAVID688846?utm_medium=d2da_iacc">Lyft</a>.</li>

    <h2>Uber & Lyft Driver Insurance Requirements</h2>

    <p>All Uber and Lyft drivers are required to have car insurance that meets the minimum financial responsibility of the state. While
    logged into the driver app Uber maintains automobile liability insurance as well.</p>

    <p>So, how does Rideshare Driver insurance requirements work? Rideshare insurance works like this: When Rideshare Driver is not logged in
    to the driver-app their covered by personal insurance policies. When a driver turns the app on they are covered by
    liability insurance from Uber/Lyft.</p>

    <p>Once a rider is picked up a high level of liability insurance is activated. This is $1 million per incident excess
    liability coverage. The rideshare insurance policies cover liability claims and not the driver’s vehicle. Personal
    insurance claims will have to be filed for the car.</p>

    <!-- Uber Eats Section -->
    <h2>How To Drive for Uber Eats</h2>

    <p>UberEATS is a delivery app that allows Uber customers to order food on demand from nearby local restaurants. The
    UberEATS delivery drivers pick up and drop off food orders as independent contractors. Many Uber drivers choose Uber
    Eats versus driving for <a class="link" href="https://drd.sh/z4sh44/">DoorDash</a> or <a class="link" href="https://pmfleet.app.link/quSRvHinS2">Postmates</a>.</p>

    <p>What are the Uber Eats driver requirements? You can become an Uber Eats driver without driving for UberX. Current UberX
    drivers can simply opt-in to start receiving UberEATS request.</p>
